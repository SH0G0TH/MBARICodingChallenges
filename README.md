Included here is the code I wrote for the interview at MBARI I have coming up soon.

I've created a seperate PDF which shows all the graphs which are produced by the code here, so this code will not need to be run to see the results.

All the code can be found in main.py, seperated in initial data parsing and the functions that peform the relevent data analysis and produce the graphs for each subquestion.
